# form3-fake-account-API-client-library
Creates a Client Library to call Fake Account API from Form3 assessment

# Instructions:
The client library can be invoked from Postman. Inside the collection found in ~\client-library\docs\Form3 API - Production.postman_collection.json, there's a folder called "Home Test - FÃ¡bio" where there are examples of invoking the developed client library.

I hope the delivery is within the determined standards and I would like to remind you that I didn't know the GoLang language and this is my first project.

# Some materials I used as examples to build the client library:
